    "Recently, Spotify has decided to try and improve the recommendation system used by their current app by implementing something that is more content-based. As a data scientist I was hired to create a recommender that recommends songs based on Artist and Song Title, additionally I am to include a similar time frame for the release year of the song. Spotify requested that I focus on song features like Danceability, Instrumentalness, Popularity of the song, etc. The goal is to improve the listener experience to make the application more appealing than other competitors like Apple Music and TIDAL by creating a model that analyzes the characteristics of the tracks and creates more niche recommendations that enhance the user experience."

    "Based on the two predictions above we received failry similar music recommendations. We can see that searching for an Artist will return anything related to that artist, or something similar. Additionally, we are able to search for a song and an artist and the recommender will return artists within the same genre and similar release years. We know that Spotify does well with their suggestion systems and it is a good way to find a variety of music from different time eras as well as sub-genres and artists. Something that could help improve the Spotify system would be having a main genre and a separate sub-genre section that way it is easier to classify songs as well as analyze the data."
